# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

The codes were written in Nim and the year 2022 is the first time that I participate (solve problems) in this event. So, I didn't determine a structure for the codes, which I believe I'll adopt over time as I understand how the problems work. However, one thing is already certain. I will send two codes a day, `part01.nim` and `part02.nim`, until I find another better way or not.

After finishing 2022, I'll try to resolve previous years.
